## Why
The project needs a dedicated project page for the website that follows the same format as the STEM Buddies example. This will showcase the HallowEyes app, its features, and development journey in a structured, presentable format suitable for a portfolio website.

## What Changes
- Create a new project page document in the docs folder following the STEM Buddies template structure
- Include project overview, features, technical details, and development story
- Add appropriate metadata for website integration (layout, title, description, tags, filename)
- Structure content to highlight the unique aspects of HallowEyes as a Halloween-themed mobile app

## Impact
- Affected specs: None (this is documentation only)
- Affected code: New documentation file in docs/ folder
- New asset: Project page markdown file for website integration
