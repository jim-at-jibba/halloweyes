## Why
The app currently uses standard light/dark theme colors but needs a spooky Halloween aesthetic to match the HallowEyes concept and enhance the user experience.

## What Changes
- Create spooky color palette with Halloween-themed colors (oranges, purples, dark backgrounds)
- Update theme system to support spooky theme variants
- Apply spooky styling to existing components and video list
- Add spooky typography styles for enhanced Halloween feel

## Impact
- Affected specs: None (new theme capability)
- Affected code: constants/theme.ts, components/themed-text.tsx, components/video-list-item.tsx, app/index.tsx
